# Adnetcoin

The primary goal is to maintain a variant of Adnetcoin that is more decentralized by using an ASIC-resistant Proof of Work algorithm, removing barriers to entry for new miners around the world and reducing the concentration of power in the hands of massive-scale mining operations.

Adnetcoin preserves and implements Adnetcoin features such as SegWit. Significant differences at launch time included:

- ASIC-resistant GPU-minable PoW algorithm (Equihash)
- Per-block difficulty adjustment algorithm
- Replay protection (SIGHASH_FORK_ID)
- Unique wallet addresses (prefixes of G and A)

Although ADNET was bootstrapped on 12 Nov to create an entirely new network, it contains the entire Adnetcoin blockchain until block 491406. As a result, Adnetcoin became a full fork with all Adnetcoin transaction history since 2009. Any Adnetcoin wallet address which held Adnetcoin in ADNET block 491406 before the fork held an equal number of Adnetcoin in ADNET block 491407 after the fork.
