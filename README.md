# Adnetcoin

The primary goal is to maintain a variant of Adnetcoin that is more decentralized by using an ASIC-resistant Proof of Work algorithm, removing barriers to entry for new miners around the world and reducing the concentration of power in the hands of massive-scale mining operations.

Adnetcoin preserves and implements Adnetcoin features such as SegWit. Significant differences at launch time included:

- ASIC-resistant GPU-minable PoW algorithm (Equihash)
- Per-block difficulty adjustment algorithm
- Replay protection (SIGHASH_FORK_ID)
- Unique wallet addresses (prefixes of A and D)
